=>Data Types 
* Character data types

  SQL supports two character data types for storing printable and displayable characters.
  i>CHAR(n)-Storing characters having pre-determined length.
  ii> VARCHAR2(n)-Storing characters whose length vary a lot.

* Integral data types

  SQL supports SMALLINT, INTEGER and INT data types that are used for storing whole numbers.  

* Non-Integral data types

  Nonintegral data types have an integer part and a fractional part. Either NUMERIC, DECIMAL
  or NUMBER data types can be used to store nonintegral numbers.
  ex:-NUMBER(4,1) (999.1)here 4 is Precision and 1 is Scale 
  ->Scale is the number of digits allowed after the decimal point. 
  ->Precision is the total number of significant digits i.e. digits both before and after the decimal point.
    If Scale is not provided then NUMBER datatype can be used to store integral values.

* Miscellaneous data types
  
  For storing date and large objects, SQL supports the following data types:
  -->DATE :Storing date data where time portion is not required 
  -->TIMESTAMP: Storing date data with precision up to 1 billionth
  -->CLOB(Character Large Object):Storing large character based data which can not be stored in VARCHAR2 due to its 4000 bytes size limit. 
  -->BLOB(Binary Large Object): Storing large binary data like movies, images with size up to 4 GB. 

=>Operators
* Arithmetic operators
  -->Addition: + eg:- 4+5
  -->Subtraction: - eg:-5-4
  -->Multiplication: * eg:-4*5
  -->Division:/ eg:- 6/2

* Comparison operators 
  -->Equal to: = eg:-15=5 false
  -->Not Equal to: <> eg:- 15<>5 true
  -->Greater than: > eg:- 15>4 true
  -->less than: < eg:- 15<4 false
  -->Greater than equal to : >= eg:- 15>=5 true
  -->less than equal to: <= eg:- 15<=5 false
  -->Range: BETWEEN<lower limit> and <upper limit> eg:- Salary BETWEEN 40000 and 50000 
  -->LIST: IN(List of values) eg:- Gender IN('Male', 'Female')
  -->String Pattern Match: LIKE eg: Gender LIKE 'B%'
  -->NUILL Test: IS NULL eg:- Salary IS NULL

* Logical operators
  -->AND: Return true if both conditions are true eg:- Name='Bhanu' and Gender='Female'
  -->Or: Return TRUE if any one condition is true eg:- Name='Bhanu' Or Gender='Female'
  -->NOT: Returns TRUE if following condition is false eg:- Id NOT IN(3,4,7,8)
